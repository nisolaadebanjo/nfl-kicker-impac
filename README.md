## Project Overview

This project was inspired by the increasing frequency of highlight-reel long-range field goals. It seeks to answer a key strategic question: **Are NFL kickers becoming so powerful that they could fundamentally change offensive strategy?**

Using over two decades of play-by-play data (25,000+ attempts), I built a logistic regression model to identify the most significant factors in field goal success. The analysis moves beyond simple percentages to create custom metrics that quantify both situational pressure and the evolution of kicking power over time.

The key finding is that while the 65+ yard field goal is not an imminent threat, the **dramatic improvement in accuracy and frequency from the 55+ yard range** represents a fundamental shift in the game's strategic landscape.
